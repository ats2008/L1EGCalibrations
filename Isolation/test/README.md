## Step 1 and 2 : Making the Working points and filling the Isolations
  * For compiling :
  ```
  make isolationAnalysis
  ```
  
## Step 3 and 4 : Obtaining Rate and Efficincies
  * For compiling :
  ```
  make applyIsolation
  ```
## Step 5 : Deriving the optimal LUTs
  * Use the notebooks in `analyzer` directory
